## Getting Started

Once you have logged in, get started by clicking Create Test. You will be prompted to enter a starting URL for the test. 

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/quickstart/create_test.png" />
</Frame>

Enter in a URL (don't worry about the https prefix, we got that covered), and get started.

### Test Creation Actions

Once the test creation page loads with a browser that has navigated to the starting URL, you can start creating a test. 

The most common way to create a test is to click through the required actions for the test on the browser displayed. 

As you take each action, you will be able to see the captured event on the left side - this will include a natural language description and the associated Playwright code for the action.

</Frame>


### AI steps

The other alternative is to add an AI step to the test by clicking "Add AI step" on the top bar of the test display. 

When you do this, you will see a step get added to the steps on the left side. This step will default to a "Click", but you can click on the action dropdown and select a different action (like "Type" for example). Write a brief description of what you want the AI Step to do. 

When you have described the AI action to take, you can click on the target icon on the right side of the step card - this will identify the element described and flash the element in a red highlight for you to visually confirm. The visual flashing is a newer, experimental feature so bear with us if the visual confirmation doesn't occur consistently - you can still keep adding steps to the test and continue creating the test.

  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone your docs locally">
    During the onboarding process, we created a repository on your Github with
    your docs content. You can find this repository on our
    [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). To clone the repository
    locally, follow these
    [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
    in your terminal.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Preview changes">
    Previewing helps you make sure your changes look as intended. We built a
    command line interface to render these changes locally. 1. Install the
    [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the
    documentation changes locally with this command: ``` npm i -g mintlify ```
    2. Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where
    `mint.json` is): ``` mintlify dev ```

### Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install our Github app">
  Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
  don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
  your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
  successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
  of the repo.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes">
  [Commit and push your changes to
  Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
  for your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that
  the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
  update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
